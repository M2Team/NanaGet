**All kinds of contributions will be appreciated. All suggestions, pull 
requests and issues are welcome.**

## Features

  the customized version of aria2 (https://github.com/aria2/aria2#features)
  which is specialized for MSVC toolchain. 
- Multi-language Support: English, German, Japanese, Traditional Chinese and 
  Simplified Chinese.
- Packaging with MSIX for modern deployment experience.
- Modernize the UI with XAML Islands with dark and light mode support. (Dynamic
  dark and light mode switching is supported for Windows 11 and later.)
- Full High DPI and partial Accessibility support.

- Supported Platforms: x86, x86-64(AMD64) and ARM64.

### MSIX Package

You also can download the MSIX Package in 
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaGet/releases).

After you have downloaded the MSIX Package, you can double click to install it,
or you can execute the following command in the Command Prompt which is run as 
the Administrator.

> PowerShell -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Add-AppxPackage -DeferRegistrationWhenPackagesAreInUse -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Path `The path of the MSIX package`

P.S. All needed dependencies are included in the MSIX Package of NanaGet 
because we known that it's very difficult for users who do not have access to 
the store to get our dependency packages, and we want to be robust and 
deployable everywhere.
